# IKE and IKEv2
IKE is an IPSec-based tunneling protocol that provides a secure VPN communication channel and defines automatic means of negotiation and authentication for IPSec security associations in a protected manner.
1998 → IKE
2005 → IKEv2

## Benefits of IKEv2 VPN Protocol
### Security
IKEv2 employs server certificate authentication, which means it won’t perform any actions until it determines the requestor's identity.

### Reliability
In the first version of the protocol, if you tried to switch to a different internet connection, e.g. from Wi-Fi to mobile internet, with VPN on, it would disrupt the VPN connection and would require a reconnection.

Thanks to the reliability measures implemented in IKEv2, this issue has been fixed. Moreover, IKEv2 implements a MOBIKE technology, which allows it to be used by mobile and multi-homed users.

### Speed
Well-minded architecture and effective message exchange system in IKEv2 allow for better performance.
