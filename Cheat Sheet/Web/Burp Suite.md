## Tools
### Spider
Used to map the target web application. The objective of the mapping is to get a list of endpoints so that their functionality can be observed and potential vulnerabilities can be found.
```ad-info
A web crawler (also known as a web spider or web robot) is a program or automated script which browses the World Wide Web in a methodical, automated manner. This process is called Web crawling or spidering. Many legitimate sites, in particular search engines, use spidering as a means of providing up-to-date data.
```

### Proxy
Intercepting proxy that lets the user see and modify the contents of requests and responses while they are in transit. The proxy server can be adjusted to run on a specific loop-back ip and a port.

### Intruder
It is a fuzzer. This is used to run a set of values through an input point. The values are run and the output is observed for success/failure and content length.
The intruder is used for:
-   Brute-force attacks on password forms, pin forms, and other such forms.
-   The dictionary attack on password forms, fields that are suspected of being vulnerable to XSS or SQL injection.
-   Testing and attacking rate limiting on the web-app.

### Repeater
Lets a user send requests repeatedly with manual modifications.
The Repeater is used for:
-   Verifying whether the user-supplied values are being verified.
-   If user-supplied values are being verified, how well is it being done?
-   What values is the server expecting in an input parameter/request header?
